#BootstraPHP v0.1

##About

The idea is to use Bootstrap and PHP to build a framework of modules
used for rapid development of web projects. Goals are to make it
flexible (as in, useful in many senarios), responsive (as in RWD), standards
compliant (where practical), and ensure it contains everything the
modern website needs right out of the box.

There will be some components that aren’t needed but it is easy to
remove what’s not required as things are laid out nice and logically.

Please report bugs via the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/Trippnology/BootstraPHP/issues) or better still, fix
them and send a pull request! Likewise if you have suggestions for
improvement, use the issue tracker or send a pull request.
